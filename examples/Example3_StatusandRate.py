	Reading distance from the laser based VL53L1X

	This example configures the sensor to short distance mode and then
	prints the distance to an object. The output also includes a
	running average of the last 10 readings along with some statistics,
	like signal rate and frequency (of the measurements).
	
	If you are getting weird readings, be sure the vacuum tape has been
	removed from the sensor.
